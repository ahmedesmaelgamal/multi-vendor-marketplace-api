## About

This repository contains selected code samples from the Well7 platform, developed during my work at TopBusiness. The project involved architecting a unified backend serving three separate mobile applications.

## Project Overview

The system consists of three interconnected apps:
- **Customer App:** Create product requests and receive quotes
- **Provider App:** Manage products and submit competitive offers
- **Delivery App:** Accept and fulfill delivery orders

## How It Works

1. Customer creates a request for specific products
2. Request appears to all providers who have those products
3. Multiple providers submit competitive quotes/offers
4. Customer reviews offers and accepts one
5. Order moves to delivery workflow
6. Delivery driver accepts and completes the order

## Key Features

- Dynamic quote-based ordering system
- Real-time order management with multi-stage status tracking
- Product management (CRUD, pricing, inventory) for providers
- Delivery driver assignment and tracking
- Notifications for all parties at each order stage
- Optimized concurrent operations across multiple user types

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Laravel
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Architecture:** Multi-app unified backend
